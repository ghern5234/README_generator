# README Generator



## Description

This is a application designed to generate custom README files for your projects with ease. This tool allows you to create a basic structure for your README file with common sections like project description, installation, usage, and more.

- The motivation behind this project was to make the process of writing a README file simple, fast and efficient.
- I built this application to help users save time and ensure their README file is profesional and functional.
- This project taught me how to import and export data, use switch/case, the power and differences in iterating through an array vs an object and how to use the inquire package in a node project.
