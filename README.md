# README Generator



## Description

This is a application designed to generate custom README files for your projects with ease. This tool allows you to create a basic structure for your README file with common sections like project description, installation, usage, and more.

- The motivation for the project was to make the process of writing a README simple, fast and efficient.
- I built this project to help those creating new project, create a README file in the correct format.
- It solves needing to create a README from scratch everytime.
- I learned how to import and export data, use switch/case, and how to write new files using the terminal/node.
