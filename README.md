# README Generator

## Description

This is a application designed to create a README markdown for those who need a professional and high-quality README for their projects.

- The motivation for the project was to make the process of writing a README simple, fast and efficient
- I built this project to help those creating new project, create a README file in the correct format.
- It solves needing to create a README from scratch everytime.
- I learned how to import and export data, use switch/case, and how to write new files using the terminal/code.


## Installation
